This section breaks down how **LevelApp** works behind the scenes.

You’ll learn about the core concepts that power the system:

1. [Simulators](simulators) – how conversations are triggered and responses collected  
2. [Evaluators](evaluators) – how replies are scored against expectations  
3. [Scoring](scoring) – how similarity is measured and results are aggregated  
4. [Batch Tests](batch-tests) – how evaluations are structured and submitted  

Each piece works together to help you test AI models reliably and consistently.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Welcome to **LevelApp**! This section will guide you through:

1. [Installation](installation)  
2. [Configuration](configuration)  
3. [Your First Evaluation](first-evaluation)  
4. [Understanding Results](understanding-results)  

Each step builds on the previousâ€”once youâ€™ve installed and configured, youâ€™ll run a simple evaluation and learn how to interpret its output.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If youâ€™re already familiar with installation, jump straight to [Configuration](configuration).

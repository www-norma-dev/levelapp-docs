# LLM as Judge Evaluators

## The LLM as Judge Methodology

LevelApp implements the **LLM as Judge** approach, where Large Language Models evaluate the quality of AI-generated responses by comparing them against reference outputs. This methodology leverages the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs to provide nuanced, context-aware evaluations that go beyond simple string matching.

### Core Concept

The LLM as Judge pattern works by:
1. **Presenting both texts** to a judge LLM (generated vs. expected)
2. **Providing evaluation criteria** and scoring guidelines
3. **Receiving structured feedback** with scores and justifications
4. **Ensuring consistency** through standardized prompts and formats

### Why LLM as Judge?

- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning beyond exact word matching
- **Context Awareness**: Considers nuances, synonyms, and paraphrasing
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides explanations for scoring decisions
- **Flexible Criteria**: Can adapt to different evaluation needs
- **Human-like Judgment**: Mimics expert human evaluation patterns

## Provider Implementations

LevelApp supports multiple LLM providers for the judge role, each with specific advantages:

### Architecture Overview

```
BaseEvaluator (LLM as Judge Pattern)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpenAIEvaluator (GPT Models)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IonosEvaluator (IONOS Cloud Models)
```

All evaluators implement the LLM as Judge pattern with:
- `build_prompt()` - Constructs evaluation prompts with criteria
- `call_llm()` - Makes API calls to the judge LLM
- `evaluate()` - Orchestrates the complete evaluation process
